# Human decision gates — gerege-nbfi migration

`/softhouse-program` appends a block here whenever it reaches a `user` gate, then parks that context and moves to the next unblocked one. **No automation crosses a gate.** Buyan resolves them here (or in the run report) and the next fire picks the context back up.

Gate classes that always stop:
- **CUTOVER** of any context from Fineract to Go — requires vectors passing + a clean shadow-parity window + regulatory / parallel-run sign-off.
- **CONTRACT** — ratifying or amending DEC-n / the frozen adapter contract.
- **REGULATORY** — FRC / external-audit acceptance, parallel-run sign-off.
- **ACTIVATION** — enabling deposit-taking behavior (FRC / Bank of Mongolia licensing). Porting savings code is not gated; switching it on is.
